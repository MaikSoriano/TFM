`oletools <http://www.decalage.info/python/oletools>`__ is a package of
python tools to analyze `Microsoft OLE2
files <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_File_Binary_Format>`__
(also called Structured Storage, Compound File Binary Format or Compound
Document File Format), such as Microsoft Office documents or Outlook
messages, mainly for malware analysis, forensics and debugging. It is
based on the `olefile <http://www.decalage.info/olefile>`__ parser. See

Download and Install:
---------------------

The recommended way to download and install/update the **latest stable
release** of oletools is to use
`pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`__:

-  On Linux/Mac: ``sudo -H pip install -U oletools``
-  On Windows: ``pip install -U oletools``

This should automatically create command-line scripts to run each tool
from any directory: ``olevba``, ``mraptor``, ``rtfobj``, etc.

To get the **latest development version** instead:

-  On Linux/Mac:
   ``sudo -H pip install -U https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/archive/master.zip``
-  On Windows:
   ``pip install -U https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/archive/master.zip``
